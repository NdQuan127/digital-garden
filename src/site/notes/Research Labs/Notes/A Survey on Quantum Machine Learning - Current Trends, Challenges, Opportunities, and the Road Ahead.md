# Introduction

- The limitations of current computing infrastructures and technologies constrain the computational capabilities of ML systems.
- According to Mooreâ€™s law, the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. However, this trend has reached its limits with current high-end CPUs and GPUs.
$\Rightarrow$ An urgent need to explore new technological avenues of hardware systems that can enhance the computational efficiency $\Rightarrow$ Quantum Computing (QC)

-  A common way to reveal properties of an unknown quantum state, having many copies of a system in that state, is to measure different observables and to analyze the results statistically. The unknown quantum state can play an active role in this analysis. Given multiple copies of a quantum system with its respective density matrix, it is possible to perform the unitary transformation. Its result generates quantum coherence among different copies of the system.
